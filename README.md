# Bioinformatics Databases with Biopython

## Overview
This repository contains tools and scripts to access, parse, and visualize data from various bioinformatics databases using Biopython. It integrates functionalities for sequence alignment, fetching nucleotide and protein sequences, exploring protein motifs, and interacting with pathways and genes in KEGG.

## Features

1. **Sequence Alignment**: Perform sequence alignment using NCBI BLAST.
2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Extract PUBMED articles and nucleotide sequences via ENTREZ.
   - Fetch protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
   - Access PROSITE & SCANPROSITE data from EXPASY for protein motif analysis.
3. **Pathway and Gene Analysis**:
   - Interact with KEGG pathways and genes to retrieve and analyze metabolic and genetic data.
4. **File Format Handling**:
   - Parse and manipulate bioinformatics file formats including FASTA, PDB, GENBANK, and XML.

## Prerequisites

### Tools and Libraries
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Biopython library (`pip install biopython`)
